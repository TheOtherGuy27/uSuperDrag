# Drag To Search
Search for dragged text

## Description
This Chrome extension provides "Super Drag" for selected text and link. If you drag-and-drop selected text or link, it will be searched for by the specified search engine (default: Google) or opened in a new tab.

In addition, this extension enables us to drag link text horizontally and select it, just like Presto Opera.
